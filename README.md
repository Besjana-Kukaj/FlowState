- ∞ means safe runway with current projections

### **Monthly Runway**
- How many months your current balance will last
- Based on average monthly burn rate
- Helps with long-term planning
- Factors in both fixed and variable expenses

## 🤖 AI Features

- Extract transaction dates, amounts, and descriptions
- Categorize transactions (payroll, rent, utilities, etc.)
